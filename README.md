UIColor+Hex
===========

Small and handy Objective-C category for UIColor.
It saves you the trouble of creating colors with `[UIColor colorWithRed: blue: green: alpha:]` and doing the math for them.

Insead, just include the header `#include "UIColor+Hex.h"` and have a blast using `[UIColor colorWithHex: (NSString *)]`
